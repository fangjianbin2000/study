# Code is fun

Coding is a pleasant brain sport. I like to explore different kind of technology. Writing a few code snippet help me to undertstand the syntax or detail of different computer languages, framework or library. Nothing serious but a lot of fun here.


Here is partial list of technology that I am intersted in. I classified it from different level of understanding:

* Heard it - Heard the word but don't know the what does it exactly meaning.
* Knew it - Knows the definition but don't know how to use it.
* Learned it - Finished reading tutorial and used it in learning purpose.
* Used it - Used it in official product.
* Master it - Can teach others. If want, can write an article or book about it.
